<h2>Web Server</h2>
On the software side, a web server includes several parts that control how web users access hosted files,
at minimum an HTTP server. An HTTP server is a piece of software that understands URLs (web addresses) and
HTTP (the protocol your browser uses to view webpages). It can be accessed through the domain names (like
mozilla.org) of websites it stores, and delivers their content to the end-user's device.
