<h2 class="normal">Pojo / Popo</h2>
<div align="left">
    A JavaBean is a POJO that is serializable, has a no-argument constructor,
    and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods that
    follow a simple naming convention.<br>
    In PHP we will create this kind of POPO classes to manage the work with
    application data.
