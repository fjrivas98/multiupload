    Since a single SQL Injection vulnerability permits the hacking of your website, and every
    hacker first tries SQL injection flaws, fixing SQL injections are the first step to securing
    your PHP powered application. Prepared statements are very secure. In a prepared statement,
    data is separated from the SQL command, so that everything user inputs is considered data
    and put into the table the way it was.
