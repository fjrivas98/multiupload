<h2>Security issues</h2>
<p align="left">
    Using $_REQUEST is strongly discouraged. This super global is not recommended since it
    includes not only POST and GET data, but also the cookies sent by the request. All of
    this data is combined into one array, making it almost impossible to determine the
    source of the data. This can lead to confusion and makes your code prone to mistakes,
    which could lead to security problems.
