<h2 class="lower">&lt;section&gt;</h2>
<div align="left">
    &lt;section&gt; is similar to &lt;article&gt;, but it is more for grouping
    together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece
    of functionality. It's considered best practice to begin each section
    with a heading; also note that you can break &lt;article&gt;s up into
    different &lt;section&gt;s, or &lt;section&gt;s up into different
    &lt;article&gt;s, depending on the context.
